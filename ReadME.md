The lack of accessibility to healthcare information and increase in misinformation has greatly impacted many Americans. Additionally, doctors are struggling with an intense data overload and need strong data analytics solutions to make use of all the data that a patient provides. In a talk by Dr. Paul Tang, internal medicine doctor in Los Altos California, I learned that 81% of the time doctors cannot find answers to important questions that come up during diagnosis. By creating an app that increases accessibility to medical information, I could bridge the gap to help doctors and patients make more informed decisions together.

This is why this project contain four major parts:
1.	Search Engine: This reviews recent and relevant scientific literature to make it easy for the average person to receive medical information. The search engine was built by applying few-shot learning to a Large Language Model (LLM).
2.	Forum/Discussion Board: This connects people to form communities around different diseases and drugs.
3.	Personalized Health Profile: This consists of a medication tracker as well as surveys related to nutritional/dietary data.
4.	Video Chats with Doctors: This allows doctors to write prescriptions in real time and allows doctors to provide advice regarding prescriptions.
